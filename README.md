# Projects
A space for my ongoing projects

## Why?
I am learning how to code in python and I needed a space where I can store my
attempts at writing nice and decent code. As I really didn't use my Github
account I thought, this is as good a time as any to start.

I am not a 'real' coder by any means, but I'm learning. So if you have any
comments or suggestions, please be kind. I really want to learn.

## The license
I chose the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net) license as I really don't think my code deserves anything more
than that.
