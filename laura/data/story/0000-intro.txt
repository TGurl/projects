Did you hear that correctly? Did he just say what you think he said?

"What?!" you ask in total disbelieve.

"Yes, you heard it correctly," your uncle guessed your thoughts, "You
are 18 now, Laura, it's time to get serious about things. So, if you
don't get married before your 25th birthday you will have to be my
sex-slave for a while month."

"But, if you do? Then you will win 10 million dollars!" the old man
grinned as he spoke the last words.

"But what if I don't want to marry?" you protest.

"Well, then my question will be: when can you move in to accomodate my
every wish and command?"

'Oh, what to do?' you think, 'I don't want to sleep with this guy!
First of all he's my uncle, second of all he's OLD. But I really don't
want to be forced to marry either.'

Reluctantly you agree with the bet, because you don't see any other
way out of it.

                        Welcome to LAURA!
